      "prompt": "Question: Olivia is organizing a charity event where she plans to hand out goodie bags to guests. She initially prepares 24 bags, each containing 3 small toys, 2 candy bars, and 5 stickers. After checking the guest list again, she realizes that 8 more children are attending than she expected. So she decides to prepare 8 more bags. However, when she goes to the store to get more supplies, she learns that the toys are sold only in packs of 6, candy bars in packs of 4, and stickers in packs of 10. She buys 4 packs of toys, 5 packs of candy bars, and 5 packs of stickers. After returning home, she assembles the remaining 8 bags. Later, she finds out that 3 of the original bags had missing candy bars, so she opens those bags and replaces the missing items. The next morning, she realizes she miscounted the total number of guests, and actually only 26 children are attending, not 32 as she previously thought. She decides to store the extra bags for a future event. How many complete goodie bags does Olivia now have available for the event, assuming each bag must contain exactly 3 toys, 2 candy bars, and 5 stickers?
